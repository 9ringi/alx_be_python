#Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
sum = number1 + number2
difference = number1 - number2
product = number1 * number2



#Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.
print("difference of", number1, "and", number2, "is", difference)
